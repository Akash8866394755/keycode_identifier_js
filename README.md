Using the learning phase of javascript, I am finally implementing a keycode identification web application here.
When I understand about JavaScript's BOM (Browser Object Model) Object, I can create it quickly and without any issues.
I am familiar with the functions and properties of the BOM Object in keyboard programming, and I want to use JavaScript to create a web application for keycode identifiers
This project includes a function that allows users to retrieve any keycode they have entered using the keyboard. In programming, each key you press on the keyboard has a corresponding keycode; similarly, you need to be aware of keycodes if you wish to execute a function on a key. You can disable the copy and paste functions with keycode. Thus, I occasionally get into a lot of issues trying to figure out how to obtain a keycode to execute keyboard functions. To fix these issues, I use this kind of creating keycode finder wep program.
After a while, I have to create another feature because of my knowledge of JavaScript.
My goal is to develop any web application with minimal latency.
